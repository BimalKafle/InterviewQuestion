1.Create a button with some width and height and a curved corner on top-right and bottom-left.
This button will toggle between red and blue background colors on click.

2.Create a div of 100px * 50px and a button. The button click will rotate the div with its top left as
origin. If clicked again, the div will revert to its initial position. Here, red div is initial while blue is
the div after rotation

3.Create multiple choice radio button with another dropdown. According to the value of the radio
button, the options shown in dropdown changes. Eg:
o If Mobile is selected, in the dropdown, Android and iOS are shown as options.
o If PC is selected, in the dropdown, Windows, Linux and MacOS are shown as options

4.Create an array of length 10 with random values from range 1-99. Then count the tens value and
show it as consecutive *. Try to be logical in this question and donâ€™t hard-code this part eg. &gt;0
and &lt;10. Think how you can implement the same code for bigger ranges like 1-999 without
increasing the code length.
